Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, but their computational intensity poses significant
challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines a Posit Fused Multiply and Accumulate (FMA) unit with systolic array (SA) architectures to enhance CNN hardware efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy levels. Unlike uniform precision schemes, our approach allows each processing element (PE) in the systolic array to use different Posit configurations, optimally allocated using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-2), a meta-heuristic framework. The framework balances hardware parameters, such as silicon footprint, power consump- tion, and datapath delay, with the model classification accuracy, to evolve towards a pareto-optimal SA design solution. We validate our approach across multiple CNNs like LeNet5, ResNet- 18, and VGG11, which are trained across various datasets. The post-synthesis results obtained on 45 nm gpdk technology demon- strated, on average, hardware (product of area-power-delay) gain by 65% relative to uniform-precision SA implementations while maintaining the classification performance. All the design files are made freely available for easy adoption and further usage by the research and design community.
